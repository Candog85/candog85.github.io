          INFINITY is a text based adventure game written in Python. It was the
          first game I've ever developed in Python and used console commands as
          user input. I learned how to manage and organize my code, how to
          consider all the issues that may come with optional user input, and
          how to develop a project using a top-down methodology. It was the
          first time I had planned out a coding project in its entirety
          before starting development.

          Together with my peers, we developed a conceptiual company website for out hypothetical company, Patent-Works. We learned the basics of Bootstrap CSS and using Javascript scripts to achive functions such as page animation. We presented this website, along with the pitch for our company during our public 2024 STEAM Showcase, showcasing the website to many of the employees of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
